# rooftop-solar
An analysis of rooftop solar potential and deployment across US states


## Project overview
### Context
With photovoltaic panels continuing to plunge in price, rooftop solar is taking off across America. But deployment is uneven: despite being neighbors, Massachusetts higher per-capita rooftop solar installations than New York. That's because state policy can significantly help or hinder the deployment of rooftop solar. And while we have have good data on solar _deployment_, we usually miss the denominator: _potential_.

### Questions

- What percentage of New York State's rooftops could have solar panels on them? 
- What percentage actually do?
- What predicts that rooftop panel installations?
